This is a Dashboard Widget plus Cocoa Plugin to interface with iTunes and display album art. However, it does much more than that. It also is able to go online to fetch Album Art if nothing is found via Amazon, Google and Yesasia. It can also rate songs and display the song title.

The goal of the widget is to be as feature rich as possible but also responsive and clutter-free interface. If you think something isn't following that philosophy, then please file a bug report :)
